# 1A Field Guide

I aim to make field guides for all American states and territories with the goal of empowering citizens to understand and exercise their First Amendment rights without unnecessarily putting themselves at legal risk.

The first formally activated state handbook is the **California 1A Auditor's Field Guide**, activated September 30, 2026.

## Project status

This project is under active development. It is intended to become a public, source-cited reference for people documenting government activity from places where they are lawfully permitted to be.

The guide is **not legal advice** and does not promise that an officer, employee, prosecutor, or court will agree with a particular legal interpretation. Statutes, regulations, policies, and case law change. Every substantive entry should identify its source and the date it was verified.

## How we use AI

The 1A Field Guide is a founder-directed project built with substantial assistance from artificial intelligence. AI tools help us organize research, draft and edit explanations, develop software, and check our work. We do not pretend that AI-assisted material was written entirely by hand.

AI can make mistakes, including inaccurate legal explanations and unreliable citations. Its output is not evidence or legal authority. We aim to support substantive claims with traceable sources, distinguish verified findings from open questions, and correct errors when we find them. Those are standards we work toward, not a guarantee that every passage is error-free or independently verified.

The founder directs the project's priorities and approves publication decisions. Readers can examine our sources and revision history, question our conclusions, and [report corrections or concerns](https://github.com/PublicOversightCoalition/1A-Field-Guide-Site/issues). We believe responsible AI use should be open to scrutiny, not disguised.

## Accessibility status and reporting

Our accessibility testing, its current coverage, and its limits are documented in [ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md). This is a progress record, not a claim of full WCAG conformance. Visitors can report barriers using the [accessibility issue form](https://github.com/PublicOversightCoalition/1A-Field-Guide-Site/issues/new?template=accessibility-report.yml). GitHub issues are public; do not include sensitive information.

## Standing audit conditions

The canonical jurisdiction-neutral baseline is maintained in [docs/national-core/standing-scenario.md](docs/national-core/standing-scenario.md); [docs/california/standing-scenario.md](docs/california/standing-scenario.md) is the California overlay/crosswalk.

Unless a scenario expressly changes the facts, assume the auditor begins lawfully present in the specific public area, is peacefully gathering information, and is **not** blocking access, physically interfering, threatening, fighting, creating unreasonable noise, obstructing or intimidating public-agency business, resisting/delaying/obstructing an officer through independent misconduct, participating in the kinds of violent/unlawful gatherings or post-warning non-dispersal excluded by the standing scenario, or engaging in other unstated misconduct.

The baseline also means that a government employee, contractor, security guard, visitor, or private individual becoming uncomfortable, angry, offended, or confrontational does not silently transform the auditor's own conduct into disturbance, obstruction, intimidation, or disorderly conduct.

A later order to leave, closing time, security rule, detention, safety perimeter, meeting warning, or other new fact triggers a fresh analysis. The standing scenario does not presume that a later order is automatically valid or automatically invalid.

The project does not depend on professional status, organizational affiliation, credentials, or carrying a project ID. It is written to apply to an ordinary person documenting government activity from a place they may lawfully be, including with only a phone.

These assumptions keep the guide focused on the government's actual authority instead of repeatedly adding imaginary misconduct to a peaceful-recording hypothetical.

## Research principles

- **Primary law first.** Prefer constitutions, official code text, regulations, court opinions, court rules, and official agency policies over commentary.
- **No YouTube law.** A rule does not become correct because an auditor, police officer, employee, attorney, or commentator says it on camera.
- **No slogan law.** Statements such as "public property means I can film anything" or "if they tell you to leave, you must leave" are too broad to serve as field rules.
- **Separate rights from remedies.** A right may exist even when the immediate practical response is to preserve evidence and challenge the action afterward.
- **Distinguish authority.** U.S. Supreme Court, Ninth Circuit, California Supreme Court, California appellate authority, out-of-circuit cases, trial-court decisions, statutes, regulations, and agency policy are not interchangeable.
- **State the limits.** Every field rule should identify meaningful exceptions and unresolved questions.
- **Correct the guide publicly.** When an entry is wrong or outdated, fix it and preserve the history through Git.

## Repository architecture

This repository is the **canonical public-source repository** for the 1A Field Guide under the **Public Oversight Coalition** organization.

Canonical source: https://github.com/PublicOversightCoalition/1A-Field-Guide-Site  
Public site: https://publicoversightcoalition.github.io/1A-Field-Guide-Site/

Reviewed public doctrine, Registry material, public methodology, and the source used to build the website live here. Internal investigations, requester/member-sensitive material, unpublished evidence, and pre-publication Coalition work are maintained in a separate private workspace and are intentionally not mirrored here.

The generated website is built from this source and published separately to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Handbook structure

The California handbook will cover constitutional foundations, public-forum doctrine, recording public officials, police encounters, trespass/removal, disorderly-conduct statutes, open meetings, public records, public facilities, schools, courthouses, USPS/federal buildings, emergency scenes, evidence preservation, and civil remedies.

Start with [`docs/california/README.md`](docs/california/README.md).

## Contributions

The repository is being structured so auditors, attorneys, researchers, public employees, and members of the public can propose statutes, cases, policies, corrections, and real-world case studies through issues and pull requests.
