# Sweep 010: Concord Police Headquarters Public Lobby

## Scope

Sweep 010 is the next cross-category Facility Prep and forum-doctrine test after Concord DMV.

**Facility:** Concord Police Department Headquarters  
**Agency:** City of Concord Police Department  
**Address:** 1350 Galindo Street, Concord, California 94520  
**Primary focus:** ordinary public police lobby / Community Service Desk / Records counter  
**Research mode:** documentary / pre-field  
**Field observation:** none yet

The same-city choice is deliberate. Keeping the municipal GIS, street/ROW source environment, and local government geography constant lets this sweep isolate the change in **facility purpose, security, public access, privacy, and law-enforcement function** rather than confounding those variables with a new jurisdiction.

# 1. Current public-access facts

Current official Concord sources identify Police Headquarters at 1350 Galindo Street.

The City identifies the **Community Service Desk (Lobby)** as open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The Community Service Desk page describes it as the Police Department's **primary public-facing point of contact**, located in the police lobby.

Official sources:

- https://www.cityofconcord.org/police
- https://www.cityofconcord.org/194/Community-Service-Desk
- https://www.cityofconcord.org/214/Records-Unit

The Records Unit separately states that staff assist the public at the **lobby counter** Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Current access posture:

`ORDINARY-PUBLIC-LOBBY-ACCESS-VERIFIED-DURING-BUSINESS-HOURS / PHYSICAL-CONFIGURATION-AND-SIGNAGE-PENDING`

The existence of 24/7 non-emergency dispatch by telephone does not establish 24/7 physical lobby access.

## Current public-facing functions

Current sources show that the public lobby/Community Service Desk supports functions including:

- general police assistance and information;
- liaison/referral to appropriate police units;
- non-emergency report intake;
- Records Unit services and report access at the lobby counter;
- in-person police-service transactions and referrals;
- access to the Department's separate Community Meeting Room channel when reserved/available.

The current Community Service Desk page expressly states that Concord Police **no longer offers LiveScan or fingerprinting services**. Earlier/stale City material describing fingerprinting therefore should not be used as a current lobby function.

These facts strongly establish a public-facing but purpose-limited government-service channel. They do not, by themselves, decide forum status or recording rights.

# 2. Property / frontage pass

The standard Contra Costa parcel adapter resolved 1350 Galindo Street to:

- APN `126-124-036`;
- owner field `CONCORD CITY OF`;
- display address `1350 GALINDO ST - CONCORD`;
- acreage `5.06`;
- building-square-footage field `71,913`;
- Assessor Book 126 Page 12.

The parcel source also carries `full_n_address = 1950 PARKSIDE DR`. That field is preserved as source data and is not substituted for the Police Department's public Headquarters address.

Current parcel posture:

`OFFICIAL-GIS-RESOLVED / CITY-OWNERSHIP-STRONGLY-SUPPORTED / HUMAN-MAP-REVIEW-COMPLETED`

## Assessor map

Book 126 Page 12 was retrieved, rendered, and visually reviewed. It depicts target parcel `36`, approximately `5.06 Ac`, **east of Laguna Street and directly adjoining Galindo Street**.

That is materially different from the Concord DMV frontage anomaly. Here, the official public address, parcel geometry, assessor sheet and Galindo road data are mutually compatible.

Current result:

`GALINDO-FRONTAGE-STRONGLY-SUPPORTED / NO-DMV-LIKE-ADDRESS-FRONTAGE-MISMATCH-OBSERVED`

### Vacated-instrument notation

The assessor sheet also contains:

`VACATED 94-188992 7-25-94`

Visual review places that notation **west of Laguna Street in the parcel 24 / historical-lot area, not inside target parcel 36**.

Accordingly:

`RECORDED-INSTRUMENT-LEAD-OBSERVED / APPEARS-OUTSIDE-TARGET-PARCEL / NOT-PROMOTED`

This is a useful application of the outcome-determinative gate. The project should not chase instrument `94-188992` merely because it appears somewhere on the assessor sheet when the map itself places the notation outside the Police Headquarters target parcel.

The sheet also contains historical headings including `RANCHO MONTE DEL DIABLO`, `FOSKETT'S SECOND ADDITION M.B. 3-73`, and `JOHNSON'S ADDITION M.B. 20-512`. Those remain historical-chain context rather than automatically promoted current-boundary records.

## Candidate adjoining parcels

The parcel resolver returned three non-target polygon-intersection candidates:

- APN `126-124-030`, 0.816 acre, owner `CONCORD CITY OF`;
- APN `126-124-032`, 0.384 acre, owner `LIU JULIE J`, 1302 Galindo Street;
- APN `126-124-033`, 0.67 acre, owner `CONCORD CITY OF`.

These remain GIS discovery candidates. The two additional City parcels may matter to circulation or a broader municipal site configuration, but current physical/site correlation is required before assigning them a role in the public entrance, parking, or pedestrian route.

# 3. Galindo / road / sidewalk leads

The Concord Road Centerlines adapter was run against Galindo, Laguna, Oak, and Mount Diablo from the facility point.

The strongest frontage lead is the closest Galindo segment:

- OBJECTID `215722`;
- approximately `61.9 m` from the facility point used for ranking;
- owner `Concord`;
- jurisdiction `Concord`;
- Major Arterial;
- right-side address range `1350–1370`;
- sidewalk L/R `No / Yes`;
- facility ID `TCL163922`;
- updated 2020-04-27.

The address range containing `1350`, the public facility address, and the assessor-sheet depiction of parcel 36 adjoining Galindo strongly corroborate the public street orientation.

The adapter also returned nearby Concord-owned/jurisdictional Laguna and Oak segments. The exact-name query did not return a `Mount Diablo` centerline record, so no Mount Diablo street/sidewalk conclusion is drawn from that run.

As always:

- centerline geometry ≠ surveyed ROW edge;
- `Street Owner = Concord` ≠ every adjacent paved area is City ROW;
- `Sidewalk = Yes` ≠ title to the sidewalk strip;
- an address range ≠ parcel-frontage survey.

Current property/frontage posture:

`PROPERTY-CHAIN-CLEANER-THAN-DMV / GALINDO-PUBLIC-FRONTAGE-STRONGLY-SUPPORTED / EXACT-SIDEWALK-ROW-EDGE-AND-PARKING/APPROACH-CONTROL-PENDING-WHERE-OUTCOME-DETERMINATIVE`

The next property question is physical/site correlation, not broad historical title archaeology.

# 4. Agency-specific recording policy: CPD Policy 423

Concord Police Department Policy Manual **Policy 423, Public Recording of Law Enforcement Activity** is directly relevant and materially more specific than the generic facility-policy record available in earlier sweeps.

Official policy source:

https://www.cityofconcord.org/1196/Department-Policy-Manual

Current Policy 423 states, in substance, that:

- CPD recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record department members performing official duties;
- department members will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with lawful recordings;
- recording may occur from a public place or private property where the individual has the legal right to be present;
- the act of recording alone is distinct from actual interference;
- examples of interference include witness/suspect tampering, incitement, a clear safety hazard from proximity, and proximity that interferes with effective officer communication;
- officers should exercise restraint and should not use highly discretionary arrests merely as a means of preventing exercise of the right to record;
- when practicable, officers/supervisors should give clear warnings and specific directions identifying what conduct or location change is required before enforcement;
- device/media seizure is separately limited by law and policy.

Status:

`CURRENT-AGENCY-RECORDING-POLICY-VERIFIED / SCOPE-AND-LOBBY-APPLICATION-REQUIRES-AREA-SPECIFIC-ANALYSIS`

Policy 423 should not be rewritten as a blanket right to record every person, document, screen, security feature, confidential interaction, or restricted area visible inside Police Headquarters. But it is equally improper to ignore the policy and infer a camera ban merely from the facility's police/security purpose.

---

# 5. California Penal Code § 148(g)

Penal Code § 148(g) supplies an important California statutory bridge.

Within the statute's terms, taking a photograph or making an audio/video recording of a public or peace officer, while the officer is in a public place **or the recorder is in a place where the recorder has the right to be**, does not by itself constitute resisting/delaying/obstructing under § 148(a), and does not by itself create reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest.

The alternative location formulation matters here because it is not written solely around traditional public forums.

But § 148(g) does not itself:

- create a right of entry into a police facility;
- classify a police lobby as a public forum;
- invalidate every otherwise lawful conduct restriction;
- establish that a person remains lawfully present after every direction to leave regardless of the underlying authority;
- eliminate independent privacy, security, interference, or trespass questions.

The correct chain remains:

`defined subarea + lawful presence → officer activity being recorded → recording alone versus additional conduct → Policy 423 + §148(g) → actual narrower facility rule, if any → forum/restriction analysis → removal/trespass analysis`

---

# 6. Narrow CPD confidentiality / information-security policies

The current Department Policy Manual contains narrower rules that materially matter to records, screens, conversations and secure workspaces without becoming a public lobby-wide camera ban.

Relevant examples include:

- **Policy 803: Records Unit:** secure maintenance/access controls for case files and sensitive reports;
- **Policy 806: Protected Information:** access/security obligations for restricted law-enforcement information and criminal-justice systems;
- **Policy 422: Body-Worn Cameras:** officer-side privacy/confidentiality handling for specified private/confidential communications.

Current distinction:

`RECORDS/PROTECTED-INFORMATION/CONFIDENTIAL-CONVERSATION DUTIES VERIFIED / PUBLIC-LOBBY CAMERA PROHIBITION NOT CREATED BY THOSE POLICIES`

This supports an important general rule:

> **A government confidentiality duty governing government-held information does not automatically become a reciprocal duty forbidding a member of the public from recording everything visible or audible from a place where that person is lawfully present.**

If genuinely protected information is exposed at a public counter, the specific information, law, physical configuration and any valid protective restriction must still be identified.

Detailed policy review:

`docs/research/evidence/concord-police/policy-recording-review-2026-09-22.md`

---

# 7. Dedicated lobby-camera-rule search

A targeted review of current public-facing CPD pages, the current Policy Manual, Community Service Desk materials, Records Unit materials, and Police Headquarters/Community Room facility pages located Policy 423 but did **not** locate a separate published rule stating that ordinary members of the public are categorically prohibited from photography or audio/video recording throughout the Concord Police lobby.

Approved finding:

> **No dedicated public-facing Concord Police Headquarters lobby-wide ordinary-patron photography/videography prohibition was located in the online sources reviewed as of September 22, 2026.**

This does **not** establish:

- that no current physical sign exists;
- that no internal security directive exists;
- that narrower restrictions cannot apply to victims, witnesses, confidential information, screens, records, interviews, security systems, or restricted areas;
- that every recording made while physically inside the lobby is constitutionally protected;
- that the public has access outside the stated lobby hours.

Current field-verification target:

`ENTRANCE/LOBBY CAMERA-CONDUCT-SIGNAGE + PRIVACY/SECURITY LAYOUT + CONTROLLED-DOOR TRANSITIONS`

---

# 8. Federal forum doctrine: ordinary lobby

No published Ninth Circuit decision specifically adjudicating an ordinary patron's right to film inside a California police-station lobby was located in this review.

The current federal authorities nevertheless strongly support applying a **purpose-limited/nonpublic-forum-type standard** to the ordinary public police-service lobby rather than treating it as a traditional or designated public forum.

### Controlling framework

*Cornelius* and *Perry* require the forum to be defined by the access sought. Public ownership and public entry for official transactions do not themselves establish a public forum.

*Sammartano v. First Judicial District Court*, 303 F.3d 959 (9th Cir. 2002), remains the strongest published Ninth Circuit government-building comparator located for threshold classification. It treated a judicial/municipal complex as a nonpublic forum even though people entered to conduct public business, while still requiring restrictions to be reasonable in light of forum purpose and viewpoint neutral.

*Askins v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security*, 899 F.3d 1035 (9th Cir. 2018), recognizes First Amendment protection for photography/recording of matters of public interest but ties the applicable restriction analysis to the **nature of the location**. Its actual dispute concerned public/outdoor areas around border facilities and does not create a general right to record in government interiors.

*Serrano v. Sanders*, No. 23-35437 (9th Cir. May 16, 2024), reinforces peaceful observation/recording principles in a public setting, but it is an **unpublished memorandum disposition** and not precedent except as allowed by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.

Working federal posture:

`ORDINARY POLICE LOBBY: LIMITED/NONPUBLIC-FORUM STANDARD STRONGLY SUPPORTED / EXACT LABEL NOT YET NECESSARY TO EVERY RESTRICTION QUESTION / NO PUBLISHED NINTH-CIRCUIT POLICE-LOBBY FILMING HOLDING LOCATED`

For the issue most likely to matter, limited and nonpublic forums use the same core restriction standard: a restriction must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose and viewpoint neutral.

But that classification answers the **standard for an actual restriction**. It does not prove that a restriction exists.

---

# 9. Closest local activity comparator: Wilson v. County of Contra Costa

A particularly important case surfaced during Sweep 010:

**Wilson v. County of Contra Costa**, No. 14-cv-03491-SI (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2015).

This is unusually close factually because it involved:

- the **Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office**;
- a **public sheriff's-office lobby** in the same county;
- a person who entered for law-enforcement/public-service purposes;
- an audio recorder allegedly in plain view;
- officers allegedly performing official duties in the lobby;
- an arrest allegedly triggered when an officer noticed the active recording;
- Penal Code §§ 602.1(b) and 632 arguments;
- Ninth Circuit *Fordyce* recording doctrine.

At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, Judge Susan Illston held that the plaintiff had sufficiently stated a **First Amendment retaliation claim** against an officer based on recording police officers performing duties in the public CCCSO lobby. The court relied on *Fordyce*'s recognition of a First Amendment right to film matters of public interest and declined to grant qualified immunity on the pleaded facts.

This is a meaningful local activity comparator, but it is not a categorical police-lobby filming holding.

### Wilson limitations

- federal district-court decision, not binding Ninth Circuit precedent;
- motion-to-dismiss posture, requiring well-pleaded allegations to be taken as true;
- no full public-forum classification of the sheriff's lobby;
- no neutral preexisting lobby-wide anti-recording policy adjudicated;
- the case later ended after failure-to-prosecute proceedings rather than a final merits judgment after discovery/trial.

Approved status:

`HIGHLY-RELEVANT-LOCAL-DISTRICT-COURT-COMPARATOR / PLEADING-STAGE / NONBINDING / NO-FINAL-MERITS-ADJUDICATION`

Detailed note:

`docs/research/evidence/concord-police/wilson-contra-costa-sheriff-lobby-2015.md`

---

# 10. Audio privacy: Penal Code § 632

California's two-party/all-party-consent shorthand is too crude for this setting. Penal Code § 632 applies to intentional eavesdropping/recording of a **confidential communication** without consent of all parties.

The current statutory definition excludes a public gathering, open governmental proceeding, and any other circumstance in which the parties may reasonably expect the communication may be overheard or recorded.

Under **Flanagan v. Flanagan**, 27 Cal.4th 766 (2002), a conversation is confidential under § 632 when a party has an **objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded**.

Thus neither slogan is adequate:

`police lobby = all audio is fair game`

nor:

`police conversation = all audio is confidential`.

The actual circumstances matter: counter separation, acoustic privacy, who else can hear, the subject of the interaction, efforts to create privacy, and whether the setting objectively indicates that the communication is confined to the participants.

## Wilson's lobby application

In *Wilson*, defendants argued that the plaintiff's audio recording was unlawful under § 632. The court rejected that basis at the pleading stage because the amended complaint alleged that **various members of the public were in the area and could hear the conversations**. On those alleged facts, defendants had not established an objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded.

Use:

`PUBLIC-LOBBY §632 FACT COMPARATOR / PLEADING-STAGE / NOT A CATEGORICAL AUDIO RULE`

This makes current physical verification of the Concord lobby's counter/privacy configuration materially useful rather than cosmetic.

---

# 11. Penal Code § 602.1: public-agency interference and constitutional activity

Section 602.1 is especially important in a police lobby because it is often tempting to compress the analysis into `asked to leave + refusal = trespass`. The statutory text is more demanding.

## § 602.1(b) elements

For a public agency open to the public, subdivision (b) requires:

1. intentional interference with lawful agency business;
2. accomplished by **obstructing or intimidating** employees carrying on the business or persons there to transact business; and
3. refusal to leave after a qualifying request by the office manager/supervisor or a peace officer acting at that person's request.

Refusal alone does not supply the obstruction/intimidation element.

Existing controlling/published project authorities such as *Dubner* also caution against inferring intentional interference merely from refusal.

## § 602.1(d)(2): constitutional-activity carveout

Current § 602.1(d)(2) expressly states that the section **shall not apply** to:

> a person on the premises who is engaging in activities protected by the California Constitution or United States Constitution.

The Ninth Circuit in *Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department*, 533 F.3d 780 (9th Cir. 2008), specifically recognized § 602.1 as one of the California statutes using this `shall not apply` constitutional-activity language.

For Sweep 010 this means the criminal analysis must not simply assume that § 602.1 applies to the very expressive activity whose constitutional protection is disputed.

The proper chain is:

`exact activity → is it constitutionally protected on these facts? → if yes, §602.1(d)(2) excludes that protected activity from §602.1 → identify any additional conduct → test obstruction/intimidation/refusal elements against that conduct → consider other independently applicable law`

## The carveout is not immunity for additional unprotected conduct

A person cannot convert actual obstruction, intimidation, threats, or disruptive conduct into protected activity merely by simultaneously engaging in speech or recording.

A nonbinding federal habeas decision, *Sherman v. Yolo County Sheriff*, illustrates the distinction in a library setting: the record included evidence of abusive/disruptive conduct, patrons leaving, rule violations and repeated refusal. The court did not treat the § 602.1 constitutional-activity carveout as immunizing that independently disruptive conduct.

Section 602.1(e) also expressly preserves the possible application of other law.

## Wilson and § 602.1(b)

*Wilson* did not hold that § 602.1(b) can never apply in a public sheriff's lobby. It held that probable cause was not established at the pleading stage on the alleged facts, which included officers physically blocking the plaintiff from leaving and allegations that he had difficulty standing/walking. The court expressly recognized that later evidence might establish intentional interference/refusal.

Current removal posture:

`RECORDING-ALONE ≠ §602.1(b) / CONSTITUTIONALLY-PROTECTED-ACTIVITY EXPRESSLY CARVED OUT / ADDITIONAL OBSTRUCTION-INTIMIDATION CONDUCT MUST BE ANALYZED SEPARATELY / OTHER LAW PRESERVED`

---

# 12. Other police-lobby-specific persuasive authorities

Police-lobby cases outside the Ninth Circuit are useful comparators but are not controlling in California.

### People v. DeRossett, 237 Ill. App. 3d 315 (1992)

An Illinois appellate court treated an Urbana police-station lobby as a nonpublic forum. The actual facts involved a prolonged disruptive complaint/refusal episode, making it a poor analogue for quiet, noninterfering recording standing alone.

### First Defense Legal Aid v. City of Chicago, 319 F.3d 967 (7th Cir. 2003)

The Seventh Circuit stated that the interior of a police station is not a public forum in rejecting a claimed attorney-access right. The dispute concerned access to witnesses/suspects and internal station areas, not filming an officer from an ordinary front lobby.

### Brandt v. Crone, No. 21-1093 (10th Cir. Mar. 28, 2022)

The Tenth Circuit confronted speech curtailed in a sheriff's-department lobby and granted qualified immunity because it found no Tenth Circuit/Supreme Court case or clear weight of authority resolving the unique sheriff-lobby setting and perceived disruption there.

### Hoffman v. Delgado, No. 23-13213 (11th Cir. Jan. 3, 2025)

The unpublished Eleventh Circuit decision involved recording inside the Punta Gorda Police Department lobby under an actual city anti-recording ordinance. The parties proceeded under a limited-public-forum characterization; the panel noted there were good arguments the lobby was actually nonpublic and upheld the ordinance as reasonable/viewpoint neutral on the pleaded facts.

This is materially different from Concord, where no equivalent lobby-wide published anti-recording rule has been located and Policy 423 affirmatively recognizes lawful recording of officers.

### Reyes v. City of New York litigation

The New York litigation must be separated by authority.

The federal district court initially found the plaintiff unlikely to succeed on the First Amendment theory at the preliminary-injunction stage but likely to succeed under New York right-to-record statutes. The Second Circuit later certified the state-law question rather than deciding the federal merits.

In June 2026, the New York Court of Appeals held that those **New York statutes** do not extend into publicly accessible police-station lobbies, emphasizing victim, witness, confidential-informant, undercover-officer, investigative and safety concerns.

After that answer, the Second Circuit vacated the statutory preliminary injunction in August 2026 and expressly **did not decide the pending First Amendment claim**.

### Massimino v. Benoit, No. 25-1104 (2d Cir. Aug. 17, 2026)

The Second Circuit held that the First Amendment protects recording publicly visible portions of a police station from a public sidewalk and expressly distinguished that lawful exterior vantage from a claimed right of physical access inside the station.

Use:

`STRONG EXTERIOR/INTERIOR-BOUNDARY COMPARATOR / SECOND-CIRCUIT ONLY`

# 13. Concord-specific synthesis: nonpublic forum does not equal camera ban

This is the central doctrinal lesson of Sweep 010.

Concord is not presently an ordinary:

`purpose-limited lobby + published no-recording rule`

case.

Instead, the documentary record currently looks like:

`purpose-limited public police lobby + no separate lobby-wide published camera ban located + CPD Policy 423 affirmatively recognizes lawful public recording of officers + Penal Code §148(g) protects recording-alone within its location conditions + local Wilson comparator allowed a public-sheriff-lobby recording retaliation claim to proceed + §602.1(d)(2) expressly carves out constitutionally protected activity`

Therefore a federal limited/nonpublic classification tells us **what standard applies to an actual restriction**. It does not manufacture a restriction, erase activity-specific protection, or automatically establish criminal trespass.

A valid analysis requires the actual rule or actual additional conduct asserted to justify the restriction/removal.

---

# 14. Privacy/security subjects must be separated

Police Headquarters presents materially stronger privacy/security concerns than the DMV or an ordinary civic administrative lobby.

Potentially distinct subjects include:

- officers performing public-facing official duties;
- uninvolved members of the public;
- victims reporting crimes;
- witnesses;
- confidential informants;
- juveniles;
- undercover personnel;
- confidential reports and computer screens;
- private or sensitive conversations;
- access-control systems and security features;
- dispatch/records/evidence/holding/interview/operational spaces.

Do not collapse these into `recording in the lobby` as if they were legally identical.

The project should preserve the activity distinction:

`recording an officer performing a public-facing duty ≠ deliberately capturing a victim's private report ≠ capturing protected records/screens ≠ documenting a secure operational area`

Those differences may materially affect § 632 confidentiality, the reasonableness/tailoring of a restriction, and whether a direction to relocate is supportable.

---

# 15. California Speech Clause

No sufficiently close published California appellate authority was located that classifies an ordinary police-station public lobby under California Constitution article I, § 2(a).

Current posture:

`CALIFORNIA SPEECH-CLAUSE CLASSIFICATION UNRESOLVED / NO CLOSE PUBLISHED CALIFORNIA POLICE-LOBBY CASE LOCATED`

The federal limited/nonpublic result must not be copied automatically into the California column.

---

# 16. Separate opened channel: Police Department Community Meeting Room

The Department separately advertises a public Community Meeting Room at 1350 Galindo Street.

Official source:

https://www.cityofconcord.org/facilities/facility/details/Police-Department-Community-Rooms-33

The City states that nonprofit community groups may use the room for discussion of community issues that address and improve quality of life in Concord. The page states that the Department reserves the right to make reasonable **content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions** in contracting for use.

The current Community Service Desk page states the room is available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays, with capacity 45.

The public facility page says a **Community Room Contract** is completed after reservation, but the contract itself was not located in the online sources reviewed.

Current posture:

`SEPARATELY-OPENED COMMUNITY-DISCUSSION CHANNEL / CONTRACT-NOT-LOCATED-ONLINE / ACTUAL-PRACTICE REVIEW PENDING`

This room should not inherit the lobby's forum classification.

---

# 17. Required subarea decomposition

Sweep 010 separately tracks:

- ordinary municipal sidewalk / Galindo frontage;
- public parking and pedestrian approach;
- entrance threshold / vestibule;
- ordinary public lobby / Community Service Desk;
- Records counter / transaction area;
- complaint/report-intake interactions;
- Community Meeting Room;
- public restrooms, if any;
- controlled doors / employee-only corridors;
- dispatch, records workspaces, evidence/property, secure parking, holding/interview, jail, and other operational areas;
- publicly visible but nonpublic security-sensitive areas.

No building-wide forum label is assigned by inheritance.

# 18. Current working matrix

| Area / activity | Federal posture | California posture | Recording / removal posture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary Galindo municipal sidewalk | Traditional-public-forum doctrine strongly applicable once exact location established | California public-forum protection strongly implicated | Public police-recording doctrine strongest here; exact conduct still matters |
| Facility pedestrian approach / front parking | Area/control facts pending | Pending | Depends on exact location/control and actual rule |
| Ordinary public lobby / Community Service Desk | Limited/nonpublic standard strongly supported | Unresolved | Policy 423 + §148(g) + Wilson materially relevant; no separate lobby-wide published camera ban located |
| Records counter | Purpose-limited public transaction area | Unresolved | Privacy/confidentiality interests materially stronger; exact subject/rule/§632 facts matter |
| Officer performing public-facing official duties in lobby | Lobby forum standard governs location | State classification unresolved | Policy 423 + §148(g) + local Wilson comparator strengthen lawful-recording analysis if lawfully present/noninterfering |
| Victim/witness/private-report interaction | Same physical lobby may contain distinct privacy facts | Unresolved | §632 / confidentiality / narrowly tailored protective restrictions may become materially stronger |
| Community Meeting Room | Separate intentionally opened channel; contract/practice review required | Separate state analysis | Meeting-room rules govern; do not inherit lobby result |
| Restricted operational areas | Not public by inheritance | Not public by inheritance | No ordinary-lobby recording inference applies |
| Removal under §602.1 | Not itself a forum classification | Constitutional protection is expressly relevant to statutory carveout | §602.1(d)(2) excludes protected activity; additional obstruction/intimidation and other laws remain separate |

# 20. Methodological lessons emerging from Sweep 010

Sweep 010 adds several cross-category lessons that should be considered for promotion into the Facility Prep / Registry methodology after final review.

## A. Forum classification does not prove a restriction exists

> **Forum classification answers the constitutional standard for restrictions; it does not prove that a restriction exists.**

A purpose-limited/nonpublic government interior may permit reasonable viewpoint-neutral restrictions, but the project still must identify the **actual rule, direction, security condition, or additional conduct justification** before analyzing constitutionality, removal or trespass.

## B. Record both vantage point and subject

> **The subject of the recording can be legally material even when the physical vantage point is identical.**

Police-lobby research should separately record:

`where the recorder is` + `what/who is being recorded` + `whether audio is captured` + `what privacy/security conditions exist`.

## C. Use separate forum and activity anchors when necessary

*Wilson* exposes a useful refinement of the anchor-comparator method.

The closest case for **forum status** may not be the closest case for the **specific activity**.

For police/sheriff lobbies, a stronger model is:

- **forum/access anchor:** *Cornelius*, *Sammartano*, plus facility-purpose/access facts;
- **activity anchor:** *Fordyce*, §148(g), agency recording policy, and factually close authority such as *Wilson*.

One precedent need not perform both jobs.

## D. Confidentiality duties are not self-executing public-camera bans

> **Government duties to secure protected information do not automatically impose a reciprocal blanket recording prohibition on a person lawfully present in a public-facing area.**

Identify the protected information, applicable law/rule, actual exposure and the tailored restriction.

## E. Trespass analysis must include statutory constitutional carveouts

Where a trespass/interference statute expressly excludes constitutionally protected activity, the workflow must test that carveout before treating the statute as an enforcement bridge.

For §602.1:

`protected activity? → §602.1(d)(2) → additional conduct? → obstruction/intimidation elements → qualifying request → other law`

# 21. Remaining open facts

The documentary sweep and methodology promotion are complete enough for branch review. The highest-value unresolved items are now physical/current rather than broad doctrinal research:

1. verify the entrance, vestibule, lobby seating/counter configuration, privacy separation, controlled doors, public restroom availability, and camera/conduct/security signs;
2. correlate the City-owned candidate parcels and public parking/pedestrian approach to the current ground layout;
3. obtain the Community Room Contract only if that separate opened channel will be classified for publication;
4. continue maintenance searching for any closer **published** Ninth Circuit/California police-lobby authority.

These items remain expressly pending and do not need to be guessed or silently filled from analogy. The documentary Sweep 010 branch is otherwise ready for PR/MkDocs review and merge.
